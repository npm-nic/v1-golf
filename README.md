node js + react (w/react-query) live PGA tour golf scoreboard

using live PGA data from https://pygolf.jacoduplessis.co.za/api

## Current State:

this is nothing special...just had a few hours to display PGA Championship golf scores + pool data for friends

## Future:

- scrape own pga data
- create live scoreboard for users (calculate scores based on rounds)
- add overall scoreboard for entire tournament 
- add draft lobby / sessions
